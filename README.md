# PivotalAuth

PivotalAuth enables Pivots to write applications that authenticate against the Pivotal Oauth service.  Additionally, because this is Pivotal, it's designed to enable multiple people to be logged in at the same time.

## Setup

To install, add these two lines to your Gemfile:

	gem "pivotal_auth", github: "pivotal/pivotal_auth"
	gem "okta_saml", github: "pivotal/okta_saml", branch: "dev"

Add this line in your routes:

	mount PivotalAuth::Engine, at: '/'

Make sure you also have a root route defined. This is where users will be redirected to after login, unless they have previously visited a page that requires authentication.

Run these lines:

```
$ bundle
$ rails g pivotal_auth:init
```

Ignore the `Missing okta_saml.yml file in Rails.root/config` warning.

## Environment Variables and Okta Setup

The gem requires two env variables: `OKTA_LOGIN_URL` and `OKTA_CERT_FINGERPRINT`. These are specific to the Okta app you are authenticating against.

To get these values, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/primedia/okta_saml#okta-configuration) under "Okta Configuration" and "Configuration". Step 1 of the "Configuration" instructions refers to `OKTA_LOGIN_URL`. Step 2 of the instructions refers to `OKTA_CERT_FINGERPRINT`.

## Routes

- `/login`: Logs in a single user.
- `/logout`: Logs out all users.
- `/logout/user@example.com`: Logs out a single users.

If you want to use the routing helpers, you can access them through the `pivotal_auth` object:

``` haml
%p= link_to "Sign in.", pivotal_auth.login_url, id: "signin"

- current_user_emails.each do |email|
  %p= "Signed in as #{email}"
  %p= link_to "Sign out #{email}", pivotal_auth.logout_url(email)
```

## Useful Controller/View Helper Methods

- `current_user_emails` - Returns the emails of the currently logged in users.
- `user_signed_in?` - Returns if a user is signed in
- `authenticate_user!` - A before filter that will redirect to '/login' if no user is signed in. It will also set a redirect url to the current path.

## Mocking

You can mock out the actual network calls by using the OmniAuth mocking support:

``` ruby
OmniAuth.config.test_mode = true
```

...and in your specs, setup each user before attempting to login:

```
OmniAuth.config.add_mock(:default, {:info => {:email => "#{name}@pivotallabs.com"}})
```

Bonus points for adding webmock:

```
WebMock.disable_net_connect!
```
